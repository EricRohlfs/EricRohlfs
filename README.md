- 👋 Hi, I’m @EricRohlfs
- 👀 I’m interested in web development especially ES6+ customElements as well as machine learning. 
- 🌱 I’m currently/always learning about better ways to do web development. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ES6+ customElements and spreading the word that 3rd party OSS stacks are not as necessary as they once were.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
